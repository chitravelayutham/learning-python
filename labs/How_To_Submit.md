# How to work with labs?

- Each lab follows a problem, solution and discussion structure. There will be
  multiple recipes in each lab (typically 10 or more). Each recipe is a problem
  statement.
- `Problem` states a problem definition. Once you read the problem statement,
  try to come up with a solution, if possible.
- Some lab topics might not be covered in the class. This is because the class
  focuses on topics which are of higher importance.
- If you encounter a problem for which the concept was not discussed in the
  class or if you happen to spend more than 10 to 15 minutes to come up with a
  solution, please check the solution section.
- The solution includes the required code.

# Submission

- For each lab, please create a Notebook and execute the solution in it.
- At the end of each lab's notebook, please include a Markdown text with at
  least 500 words on what you learned from the lab and any practical connections
  you can think of.
- After you're satisfied with the solution, store the labs solutions on Github
  and provide the repository URL to the instructor.

__If you don't prefer a Notebook, you can also submit a Python file for each
lab. The practical connection still needs to be submitted as a markdown.__
__Please note that failing to submit labs will have negative impact on your
progress in the program and it will be escalated.__
